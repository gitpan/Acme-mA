=head1 NAME

Acme::ǝmɔA - Turn your perl upside down

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use utf8; use Acme::ǝmɔA;

  ɹǝpun uʍop ʍou ǝɹ,no⅄ #

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Turns your perl code upside down.

This is yet another Acme module that does something amusing yet useless to your
code. I'm afraid I couldn't resist.

=head1 BUGS

The bug density is so high this module has ceased existing and is now held
together by the bugs that are crawling through it.

=over 4

=item *

Source filter usage means __DATA__ and probably other things don't work.

=item *

Assumes UTF-8 in places it probably shouldn't.
